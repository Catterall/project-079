# PROJECT-079

The purpose of this project is to create an AI model to accurately replicat the voice of Dr SBAITSO, whereby .param has been set to 0944. This will allow for the creation of the first open-source text-to-speech technology for the voice of SCP-079.

Hopefully, if this project is successful, this will allow users to quite easily use the voice of SCP-079 in their own projects, without having to visit an MS-DOS emulator, load Dr SBAITSO, remember the .param value, type a voiceline whilst recording audio, cut and save the audio for every voiceline. Instead, this project will hopefully provide users with a way to simply type one or more voicelines, and download their sound outputs.
